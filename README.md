# Seasonal-Time-Series-Data-Prediction
Prediction and optimization algorithms for time series data.   We have data from 12 locations which are classified based on 4 seasons that is Autumn, Spring, Winter and Summer.  We have four different datasets for each season.  In every single dataset, there is the data of all 12 locations.  Which are differentiated by the identity column which contains numbers from 1 to 12.  One of the columns contains a Timestamp in the format DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS. The column is named DateTime. We need to predict the value of P, depending on other data and even previous timestamp values.   The data can be predicted using multivariate LSTM or LSTM-CNN. This is to be done for a single dataset of Autumn. Similarly, it is to be done for all 4 datasets of seasons. Apart from the above algorithms if there are any other good algorithms which we can use you can try.  Suppose a random data comes, so we want to run all four algorithms on the data and we need a optimized result.
